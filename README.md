# HEXACO: A digital personality test
## Introduction

This project will essentially be a digital personality test for the purposes of effective team formation.
Users will answer a series of questions and receive an evaluation on their personality. Users will be able to create 
profiles, allowing them to take the multiple times to see how their personality might change overtime. 

The test will be the **HEXACO** personality inventory, which rates subjects on 6 measures:
- Honesty-Humility
- Emotionality
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Conscientiousness
- Openness to Experience

This application could be used by employers and teams to assign roles based on personality. It can also be 
used by anyone who is curious about themselves.

This project is of interest to me as I graduated with a degree in neuroscience last year, 
hope to connect my prior interests with computer science.
